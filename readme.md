To download and install a Chrome extension manually from a local directory, follow these steps:

1. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to chrome://extensions.
2. Enable Developer mode by clicking the toggle switch at the top right.
3. Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.
   - For your specific workspace, the extension directory would be the directory containing the manifest.json and add_link_to_image.js files.

Please note that this method is intended for development and testing purposes. For distributing your extension to users, you should publish it to the Chrome Web Store.
